Original prompt: 初始化這個專案 git 準備一個遊戲開發

## 2026-05-05

- Initialized a Vite + TypeScript canvas game scaffold.
- Added deterministic test hooks expected by the web game workflow:
  - `window.render_game_to_text()`
  - `window.advanceTime(ms)`
- Added basic keyboard movement, collectible rune nodes, score state, and fullscreen toggle.
- Fixed initial strict TypeScript issues found by `npm run build`.
- Verified build and canvas gameplay with the web game Playwright client.
- Confirmed movement updates text state and collecting rune 2 increments score to 1.
- Replaced the handwritten Canvas loop with a Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite setup after user clarified the preferred architecture.
- Added `vite.config.ts` with Phaser chunk handling.
- Pinned `phaser` to the Phaser 3 line (`^3.90.0`) after initially catching that the unqualified package install resolved to Phaser 4.
- Forced Phaser to use the Canvas renderer so headless screenshot verification captures the scene reliably.
- Verified Phaser 3 build and Playwright screenshot/state capture; collecting rune 2 increments score to 1.

## TODO

- Decide the actual core game loop and memory mechanic for Mnemonic Spire.
- Add focused gameplay tests once the first real feature is implemented.
- Add asset pipeline conventions when art/audio direction is chosen.

## 2026-05-05 MVP Implementation

- Six implementation plans are now committed on main and execution continues in `.worktrees/mvp-e2e` on branch `feature/mvp-e2e`.
- Current target: complete the Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite MVP, then run self-designed E2E plus exploratory browser testing and fix issues until the core flow is playable.
- Test strategy: verify deterministic text state through `window.render_game_to_text()`, drive clicks through browser tests, inspect screenshots, and run boundary/exploratory paths around combat, rewards, events, rest, shop, mutation, Boss, win, and failure states.
